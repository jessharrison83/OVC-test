# OVC-test

Code test for OVC Interview

A simple table created using React and Redux. Testing done with Jest and React Testing Library.

**Note**

When planning projects, I typically evaluate the necessity of using Redux based on the anticipated scale and complexity of an 
app. Typically, due to this being a single component application, I would make simple use component-level state; however, to 
demonstrate my experience with Redux, it was included in this project, and will make future expansion on this project easier.
