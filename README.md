# OVC-test

Code test for OVC Interview

A simple table created using React and Redux. Testing done with Jest and React Testing Library.

**Note**

I utilized Redux in this project to showcase my skills, but normally I would not use Redux for a project of this size.
Because the data is only being used in one component, a component-level state would have been sufficient. However, because
the boilerplate is already complete for Redux, it will be easier to expand this project if necessary.
